It has been seven years since I last caught the New Yearâ€™s Eve fireworks. Check out the photos I took on the night below, as viewed from the [Sulphur Beach Boat Ramp](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uqFVeGBWKEs6Apow5) ðŸ‘‡.

On another note, let us all do our part to make 2025 a great year for all who cross our paths. For many, the new year is a time of reflection. I believe we can all find something to be grateful for, perhaps some more so than others. For those of us who are in a position to do so, let us make sacrifices for the good of those around us.
