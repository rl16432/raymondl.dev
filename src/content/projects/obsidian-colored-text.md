## About

This is a lightweight plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) allowing users to select and add color to their notes. 

Originally I was quite surprised that such a great note-taking app like Obsidian didn't have native color support. While Markdown formatting does allow you to add color through HTML, this was quite inconvenient having to surround your text with a styled `span` element.

I then came across a plugin that allows you to map shortcuts to color text, and thought it would be a great opportunity to make my open-source debut, by adding features to improve the plugin's usability for others and myself.

This was overall an enjoyable experience, and I can see myself making more contributions in the future.
