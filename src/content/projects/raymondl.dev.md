## About

My personal site ðŸ™‚

This site was develop using an [Astro](https://astro.build/) template. Astro is a framework that allows you to build webpages that contain no JavaScript by default, but dynamic components can be specified and added where necessary.

Work was done on the original template (linked in the footer) to migrate the template to Version 2 of Astro, particularly to make use of the content collections feature, which I think is a neat way to organize all the content for your static site, and makes updating this page as simple as creating and editing a Markdown file.
