## About

This is a full stack web application I built which served as a huge learning experience for me, gaining exposure to frontend interaction testing with Storybook, API development with ASP.NET, CI/CD and cloud deployments to name a few.

The app allows users to create a team of Pokemon of their choice, and view the teams of other trainers. This API performs CRUD operations to create, read, update and delete users, while integrating with PokéApi to *add* and *delete* Pokemon from a user's team.
